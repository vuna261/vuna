        ==================
        
        Fonts, colors and charts are not supported.
        
        **pyexcel-handsontable** is a rendering plugin to
        `pyexcel <http://pyexcel.readthedocs.org/en/latest>`_  and renders
        :class:`pyexcel.Sheet` and :class:`pyexcel.Book` into a
        `handsontable <https://handsontable.com>`_ in your web page. As long as you
        have a browser, you could view the data. However, please note
        that this library does not aim to replace any current excel softwares, such
        as Micorsoft Office. But it aims to extends the capability of a
        Python user/developer in viewing plain data.
        
        
        Main features:
        
        #. transform your excel sheets into excel alike html file.
        #. embed your excel sheets into your web page
        
        .. image:: https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-handsontable/blob/master/demo/screenshot.png
        
        Here is one liner to use it with pyexcel:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import pyexcel as p
        
            p.save_as(file_name='your.xls', dest_file_name='your.handsontable.html')
        
        
        Please remember to give this file suffix always: **handsontable.html**. It is because `handsontable.html` triggers this plugin in pyexcel.
        
        
        
        Installation
        ================================================================================
        You can install it via pip:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install pyexcel-handsontable
        
        
        or clone it and install it:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-handsontable.git
            $ cd pyexcel-handsontable
            $ python setup.py install

        Development guide
        ================================================================================
        
        Development steps for code changes
        
        #. git clone https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-handsontable.git
        #. cd pyexcel-handsontable
        
        Upgrade your setup tools and pip. They are needed for development and testing only:
        
        #. pip install --upgrade setuptools pip
        
        Then install relevant development requirements:
        
        #. pip install -r rnd_requirements.txt # if such a file exists
        #. pip install -r requirements.txt
        #. pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
        
        
        In order to update test environment, and documentation, additional steps are
        required:
        
        #. pip install moban
        #. git clone https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-commons.git commons
        #. make your changes in `.moban.d` directory, then issue command `moban`
        
        What is rnd_requirements.txt
        -------------------------------
        
        Usually, it is created when a dependent library is not released. Once the dependecy is installed(will be released), the future version of the dependency in the requirements.txt will be valid.
        
        What is pyexcel-commons
        ---------------------------------
        
        Many information that are shared across pyexcel projects, such as: this developer guide, license info, etc. are stored in `pyexcel-commons` project.
        
        What is .moban.d
        ---------------------------------
        
        `.moban.d` stores the specific meta data for the library.
        
        How to test your contribution
        ------------------------------
        
        Although `nose` and `doctest` are both used in code testing, it is adviable that unit tests are put in tests. `doctest` is incorporated only to make sure the code examples in documentation remain valid across different development releases.
        
        On Linux/Unix systems, please launch your tests like this::
        
            $ make
        
        On Windows systems, please issue this command::
        
            > test.bat
        
        
        Update styles
        --------------------
        
        `styles/style.scss` control the look and feel of the frame. In order to view the changes
        in that file, you will need to compile, moban and install it. Here is the sequence
        of commands::
        
            $ make css
            $ moban
            $ python setup.py install
            $ make -C demo
        
        Then please open handsontable.html from demo directory.
